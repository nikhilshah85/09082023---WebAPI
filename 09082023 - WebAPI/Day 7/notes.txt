More detailed conctepts for API development

1. DI - dependency Injection 
	takes care of Memory management, state management, clear reference 
		and help in performance
2. CORS - Cross Origin Shareing
	we will have to set CORS policies for our clients / other project in order
		to get the data
	(it could be any contents from our  site, image, JSON api calls, video streaming)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Let us have a look at patterns for WebAPI

	a. Create a database - airlinesManagement (Normalization)
		add a table 
			flightInfo
				flightNo (Primary key)
				fromCity
				toCity
				availableSeats
				fare
	b. Create a WebAPI application (REST standards)
	c. Add Support for Entity Framework (ORM pattern)
	d. Create an API controller to perform CRUD operations on flightInfo table
		add a controller with EF, choose table and DBContext

		do not make any changes in the controller, 
			run the application - read the error it would be about DI
